        <p>Frontend Developer specializing in React.js, Next.js, and modern web technologies.</p>
        <p> As a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Information Technology from Anantrao Pawar College Of Engineering & Research Pune, Pune University, I am eager to begin my career with a company renowned for its innovative approach and commitment to excellence.

My academic journey has been marked by a strong foundation in web development, particularly in frontend and fullstack development. Projects like the Hotel Management CRM and the Decentralized Inventory System have provided me with hands-on experience in JavaScript, React.JS, NEXT.JS, CSS, HTML, and Python. These projects have not only honed my technical skills but also taught me the importance of user-centric design and effective problem-solving. Additionally, I have completed a comprehensive fullstack development course, which has further solidified my understanding and expertise in building robust web applications.</p>
